The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. 

STL has 4 components:

1. Algorithms
2. Containers
3. Functions
4. Iterators

further

Algorithm :-
  Sorting
  Searching

Containers :-
     Sequence Containers: implement data structures that can be accessed in a sequential manner.
           vector
           list
           deque
           arrays
           
      Container Adaptors:- provide a different interface for sequential containers.
           queue
           priority_queue
           stack
           
       Associative Containers:- implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
           set
           multiset
           map
           multimap
