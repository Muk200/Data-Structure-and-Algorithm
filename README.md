# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm

A "data structure" is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

An "algorithm" is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input(s) and produces the desired output.

Qualities of a Good Algorithm
1. Input and output should be defined precisely.
2. Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
3. Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
4. An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.
